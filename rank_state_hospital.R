RankHospital <- function(state, outcome, rank="best") {
  # Reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector
  # with the name of the hospital that matches the ranking of the 30-day
  # mortality for the specified outcome in that state. The hospital name is the
  # name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. Hospitals that do not have data
  # on a particular outcome are excluded from the set of hospitals when
  # deciding the rankings.
  #
  # Args:
  #   state: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state
  #   outcome: the mortality outcome, must be one of the following:
  #     “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”.
  #   num: the ranking of the hospital within the given state
  #     Can be an integer or "best" or "worst"
  #
  # Returns:
  #   The name of the hospital within the given state with the given rank
  #   for the given mortality rate outcome.
  #   If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that
  #   state, then the function returns NA

  ## Read outcome data
  ## Check that state and outcome are valid
  ## Return hospital name in that state with the given rank
  ## 30-day death rate
